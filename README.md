# BackPacks

This Minecraft Plugin gives the players ability to craft certain backpacks,wich will store items inside them,each backpack its unique holding a UUID

By making use of the new PersistentDataType,i was able to convert a list of items into bytes,storing it inside another item,then reverting it back,sucessfully creating a viable
way to store data inside certain objects.

The plugin as all the others feature commands/permissions avaiable on the spigot page
